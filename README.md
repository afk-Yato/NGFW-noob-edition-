# NGFW-noob-edition-
this is an idea that came into my mind and tried to implement it for fun

[!] This is not ready to use (containing many mistakes still), this is only for learning purpose; To run it you will need to create a virtual environment to execute (unless you want to messup you OS's packet analyzer XD).
If you find any upgrade or new ideas to deploy pls email me :)
